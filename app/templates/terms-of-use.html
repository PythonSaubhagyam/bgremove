		<li><h2>Subscription</h2></li>
		<ul>
			<li><b>4.1</b> Photoliz independently determines the price of Subscription and published it in the Service. The use of Subscription is subject to payment in advance. Photoliz reserves the right to change its subscription fees at any time, upon notice to User if such change may affect User’s existing Subscription.</li>

			<li><b>4.2</b >User agrees that subscription fees paid by User are NOT REFUNDABLE AND NOT CANCELLABLE.</li>

			<li><b>4.3</b> All subscription fees shall be deemed to be in the currency and amount shown in Service, except as specifically stated otherwise in writing by Photoliz. To the extent permitted by law (and unless specified otherwise by Photoliz in writing), all subscription fees are exclusive of all taxes (including value added tax, sales tax, goods and service tax, etc.), levies or duties imposed by taxing authorities (“Taxes”), and User shall be responsible for payment of all applicable Taxes relating to User’s use of Service, or to any payments or purchases made by User. If Photoliz is obligated to collect or pay Taxes for the subscription fees payable by User, and whether such Taxes were added and collected from User for previous transactions, such Taxes may be added to the payment of any outstanding subscription fees and will be reflected in the invoice for such transaction.</li>

			<li><b>4.4</b> As part of registering or submitting information to receive Subscription, User also authorizes Photoliz (either directly or through its affiliates, subsidiaries or other third parties) to request and collect payment (or otherwise charge, refund or take any other billing actions) from our payment partners or User’s designated banking account, and to make any inquiries that Photoliz or its affiliates may consider necessary to validate User’s designated payment account or financial information, in order to ensure prompt payment, including for the purpose of receiving updated payment details from Users’ payment, credit card or banking account provider (e.g. updated expiry date as may be provided to us by Users’ credit card company).</li>

			<li><b>4.5</b> If User’s Photoliz account or any Subscription is canceled (whether at User’s request or at Photoliz’s discretion), it may cause or result in the loss of user data, features, or capacity of User’s Photoliz account.

			<br/>
			<li><b><h2>4.6 Subscription Renewals</h2></b></li>
			<ul>
				<li><b>4.6.1</b>In order to ensure that User does not experience any interruption or loss of Service due to the lapse of any Subscription Period, the Subscription operates with automatic renewal with Recurring Billings. Accordingly, where applicable, Photoliz will attempt to automatically renew the applicable Service for a renewal period equal in time to the original Subscription Period for such Service, and automatically charge User the applicable subscription fees using the payment method User has on file with Photoliz. In the event of failure to collect the subscription fees owed by User, Photoliz may suspend (until full payment is made) User’s Subscription or downgrade User’s Photoliz account back to a free basis account, without further notice.</li>

				<li><b>4.6.2</b> User may discontinue to use and request to cancel Subscription, in accordance with the terms herein. The effective date for cancellation of Subscription shall be at the end of User’s current Subscription Period.</li>

				<li><b>4.6.3</b> User understands that as the cancellation process may take a few days, in order to avoid the next Recurring Billing, THE CANCELLATION REQUEST SHALL BE MADE AT LEAST SEVEN (7) DAYS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD.</li>

				<li><b>4.6.4</b> Failure to comply with any of the Photoliz Terms of Service or failure to pay any due subscription fees shall entitle Photoliz to suspend or cancel User’s Subscription. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of cancellation due to breach of the Photoliz Terms of Service, User’s subscription fees are not refundable even if User’s then-current Subscription Period is not expired on the day of cancellation.</li>
